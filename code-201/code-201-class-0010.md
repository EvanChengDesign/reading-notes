## **Questions & Answers**  

### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.  

Syntax Error vs. Logic Error:
A syntax error occurs when code violates language rules, like missing parentheses, while logic errors lead to unintended behavior due to flawed logic, such as incorrect algorithm implementation.

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.  

Types of Errors Encountered in Lab Assignments:
Common errors include syntax mistakes like missing semicolons, logic errors such as incorrect conditional statements, and runtime errors like accessing undefined variables. These were usually resolved through careful code review, debugging with print statements, and analyzing error messages.

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Influence on Long-Term Goals:
Understanding and resolving syntax and logic errors are essential skills in software development, ensuring the reliability and correctness of software products in the long term.

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?  

The JavaScript Debugger is a tool for identifying and fixing errors in JavaScript code by allowing developers to pause code execution at specific points, inspect variables, and trace execution flow.

### Define what a breakpoint is.  

Breakpoint:
A breakpoint is a designated point in the code where execution temporarily halts, allowing developers to inspect program state and variables. It facilitates step-by-step code execution for effective debugging.

### What is the call stack?  

Call Stack:
The call stack manages function calls' execution sequence, with each function call adding a stack frame containing relevant information. It helps track the program's execution flow and facilitates function invocation and return.
