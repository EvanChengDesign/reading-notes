## **Questions & Answers**  

## **HTML Media**

### **What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**

The \<alt> attribute in HTML is crucial for providing alternative text descriptions for images, enhancing accessibility for users who rely on screen readers or have slow internet connections.

### **How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**  

You can improve accessibility of images in an HTML document by providing descriptive alt text, using image captions, ensuring images are responsive, and regularly testing accessibility using tools like WAVE or Lighthouse.

### **Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**  

The \<figure> element in HTML would be useful when you want to associate an image with a caption or legend, such as in articles or blog posts where you need to provide context or explanation for the image.

### **Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**  

GIF images are like traditional pictures, showing simple animations made up of frames, while SVG images are like blueprints, using code to describe shapes and allowing for scalable, high-quality graphics without losing clarity.

### **What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**

For displaying a screenshot on a website, PNG would be the preferred image type because it supports lossless compression, ensuring high image quality, and it also supports transparency if needed, making it versatile for different design requirements.

### **Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**  

Foreground color refers to the color of the text or content inside an HTML element, while background color refers to the color behind that content, like the color of a wall behind a painting.

### **Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**  

To add character to your friend's colorless blog, you could use colors that complement the content or evoke a certain mood, such as calming blues for a wellness blog or vibrant oranges for a food blog.

### **What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**  

When choosing fonts for an HTML document, consider readability, compatibility across different devices, and the overall aesthetic of the website to ensure the chosen fonts align with the brand or theme.

### **What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?**  

Font-size adjusts the size of the text, font-weight controls the thickness or boldness of the text, and font-style alters the appearance of the text, such as italicizing it.

### **Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.**

You could add spacing around characters in an h1 element by using the CSS letter-spacing property to adjust the space between individual characters, or by adding padding or margin to the h1 element to create space around the entire text block.
