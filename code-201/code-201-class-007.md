## **Questions & Answers**  

### Explain why we need domain modeling.  

Domain modeling helps to represent real-world entities and their relationships in a structured format, facilitating clearer understanding and communication among stakeholders during the development process.

### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?  

Tables should not be used for page layouts because they impair accessibility, hinder search engine optimization, and make the code less maintainable and semantically meaningful.

### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table>.  
  
Three different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table> are: 
    \<thead>
    \<tbody>
    \<tfoot>
    \<thead> represents the header of the table
    \<tbody> represents the body content.
    \<tfoot> represents the footer content.

### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?  

A constructor in JavaScript is a special method used for initializing objects created within a class. Some advantages of using constructors include code reusability, encapsulation of object creation logic, and the ability to define default property values.

### How does the term "this" differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?  

In an object literal, the keyword "this" refers to the object itself within which it is used. In a constructor, "this" refers to the specific instance of the object being created. This distinction allows for dynamic property assignment in constructors based on the instance being created.

### Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.  

Prototypes in JavaScript serve as templates from which objects inherit properties and methods. Inheritance, much like a senior designer  of a marketing firm passing down specific skills and knowledge of distinct brand elements to a junior designer, allows objects to inherit behavior and properties from their prototype, promoting code reuse and organizational efficiency.
