## **Questions & Answers**  

### Learn HTML:
1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside the \<a> element.

2. The href attribute contains the URL or destination where the link will navigate to.

3. Ensuring links on our pages are accessible to all readers can be achieved by providing descriptive link text, using proper link styling for clear visibility, ensuring keyboard navigation for links, and using semantic markup to convey the purpose of the link.

### CSS Layout:  

1. "Normal flow" refers to the default positioning of elements on a web page, where elements are laid out in the order they appear in the HTML document flow.

2. Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available, while inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Normal positioning is the default for every HTML element.

3. Some advantages of using absolute positioning on an element include precise control over its placement regardless of surrounding elements, the ability to layer elements, and the flexibility to position elements outside the normal flow of the document.

4. A key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that fixed positioning positions the element relative to the browser window, whereas absolute positioning positions the element relative to its closest positioned ancestor.

### Learn JS:
1. A function declaration defines a named function that can be called later in the code, while a function invocation calls a function to execute its code.

2. A parameter is a variable listed in the function definition, while an argument is the actual value passed to the function when it is invoked.

### Pair Programming:  

Two benefits of pair programming are improved code quality through immediate feedback and enhanced learning through knowledge sharing and collaboration. These benefits could significantly help me on my coding journey by accelerating my learning process, helping me catch errors early, and fostering a deeper understanding of programming concepts through active discussion and problem-solving with a partner.
