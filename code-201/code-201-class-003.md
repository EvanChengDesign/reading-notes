## *Readings: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model*

## **Notes Outline:**  

## **Questions & Answers**  

### **When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**  

Use an unordered list (\<ul>) in your HTML document when you have a list of items that don't need to be in a specific order, such as a list of bullet points or a navigation menu.

### **How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**  

You can change the bullet style of unordered list items using CSS. Set the list-style-type property to specify different bullet styles like disc, circle, or square.

### **When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?**  
Use an ordered list (\<ol>) when the items in your list need to be in a specific order, such as steps in a process or ranked items.

### **Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**  

Two ways to change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list:

* Use the type attribute to specify the type of numbering, such as "1" for numeric numbering, "A" for uppercase alphabetical numbering, or "a" for lowercase alphabetical numbering.  

* Use CSS to style the numbering. You can change the color, size, or style of the numbers using properties like color, font-size, or list-style.
  
### **Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**  

### **List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.**  
**What data types can you store inside of an Array?**  

### **Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**  

### **List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**  

    +=: this operator adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.  
      
    -+: it subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.  

    *=: This operator multiplies the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.  

    /=: It divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.  

    %=: This operator divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the remainder to the variable.     
### **Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**  

### **Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**  
A common real-world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program is in a login system. Consider a website where users need to enter their username and password to access certain features or content. In such a scenario, a conditional statement can be used to verify whether the entered username and password match those stored in the system's database.

### **Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**  
A common scenario where a loop is useful in JavaScript is when dealing with arrays or lists of data. For instance, consider a situation where you want to calculate the total price of items in a shopping cart. Instead of manually adding each item's price, you can use a loop to iterate over the items in the cart and accumulate their prices.
