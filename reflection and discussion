# Reflection and Discussion

### 1.  What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
### 2.  Why do we use Markdown?
Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.
### 3.  What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?  
The symbol # is known as the number sign, hash, or pound sign.  

  **1.  How many do you need to create the largest heading?**
  
   You need just one #. 
    
  **2.  How many do you need to create the smallest heading?** 
  
  You need to use 6 #'s, as there are six levels of headings.  
  
### 4.  When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
You can either use _ _or ** at both start and end of your text for bold. For italics, you would use the symbol just _ or * at both start and end of your text. 
### 5.  How do you create a link with Markdown?
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g.,  `[Name of Link]`) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g.,  `(https://insertlinkurl.com)`).
### 6.  What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
The three symbols you can use to create an unordered list are: 
1. (-) *hyphen*
2. (+) *plus*
3. (*) *asterisk*
