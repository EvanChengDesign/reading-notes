## **Command Line Tutorial**

>A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

## **Basic Navigation!**

**Commands**  
- PWD: Print Working Directory (current or present working directory)
- CD: Change Directory (no argument -> home direcotry
- ls: List the contents of a directory
- -l: Long Listing
- Tab Completion: invoke an auto complete action
- file: determine what kind of file
- ls -a: List contents of directory, including hidden files

**Absolute & Relative Paths**  

> There are 2 types of paths we can use, absolute and relative. Whenever we refer to a file or directory we are using one of these paths. Whenever we refer to a file or directory, we can, in fact, use either type of path (either way, the system will still be directed to the same location).

-  Relative path: A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
-  Absolute path: A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

## **More About Files!**

Everything is a file  
- file.exe - an executable file, or program.
- file.txt - a plain text file.
- file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

Escape Characters
(\) The backslash nullifies the special meaninng of the next character.  
Holiday\ Photos (nullfifies the double space and renders it into a regular pucntuation space)
 
## **Questions**

1. What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
-  Series of Themes
-  Syntax Highlighting
-  HTML & CSS writing EMMET
-  Code Completion
   
3. What do the following commands do?
- pwd: writes the standard output of the full path name of current directory
- ls: List files in the current directory
- cd: change current working directory
- mkdir: make a new directory
- touch:  update the timestamp of a file or directory. It can be used to create a new file if it does not already exist, or to update the timestamp of an existing file.
   
4. Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? \(Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
> in this scenario you are commanding the terminal to change your current directory to projects. Next you are making a new project directory inside. Next you are using the touch command to create a new file inside the new-project directory. This new file is newfile.md. You then change directory and us ls to list the current files in the new-project directory that was just created.
