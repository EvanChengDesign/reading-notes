## **Command Line Tutorial**

>A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

## **Basic Navigation!**

**Commands**  
- PWD: Print Working Directory (current or present working directory)
- CD: Change Directory (no argument -> home direcotry
- ls: List the contents of a directory
- -l: Long Listing
- Tab Completion: invoke an auto complete action

**Absolute & Relative Paths**  

> There are 2 types of paths we can use, absolute and relative. Whenever we refer to a file or directory we are using one of these paths. Whenever we refer to a file or directory, we can, in fact, use either type of path (either way, the system will still be directed to the same location).

-  Relative path: A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
-  Absolute path: A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
