Read: 04 - Structure web pages with HTML

### **Notes Outline:**

**HTML:**

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages.  
- It provides the structure and layout of a webpage by using various tags to define different elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.
- With HTML, developers can organize content, apply styling, and ensure accessibility across different devices and platforms.

**Semantics:**

- Semantics in web development refers to the meaning or intended purpose of elements within HTML markup.
- Using semantic HTML elements like \<header>, \<footer>, \<nav>, \<article>, etc., enhances accessibility, search engine optimization, and overall readability of the code.
- By employing semantic markup, developers can convey the structure and hierarchy of content more clearly to both browsers and assistive technologies, improving the user experience.

**Wireframe and Design:**

- Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process where designers create a skeletal outline of a webpage or application, focusing on layout and functionality.
- It helps to visualize the structure and flow of content before diving into visual design details, enabling stakeholders to review and provide feedback early in the process.
- Wireframes typically include basic shapes, placeholders, and annotations to represent various elements such as navigation menus, content sections, buttons, and forms, facilitating efficient communication between designers and developers.
