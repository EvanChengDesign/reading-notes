### **Notes Outline** 

Javascript:  

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive content on web pages. It was originally created to add interactivity to web pages in web browsers, but it has since evolved to be used for server-side development (with Node.js), mobile app development (with frameworks like React Native), and even desktop application development (with frameworks like Electron).

JavaScript enables developers to:

- Manipulate HTML and CSS to dynamically update the content and styling of web pages.  
- Respond to user interactions such as clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.  
- Fetch data from servers asynchronously using AJAX or Fetch API.  
- Create interactive web applications, games, and multimedia content.  
- Build complex web applications with frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js.  
- JavaScript is a core technology of the web alongside HTML and CSS, and it's supported by all modern web browsers without the need for plugins.
