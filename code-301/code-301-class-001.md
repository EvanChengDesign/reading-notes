 **What are the characteristics of a component?**  
  Components are characterized by their encapsulation, reusability, and the ability to be independently deployed and composed, which enhances maintainability and scalability in software development.

 **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**  
  The advantages include reduced development time, increased reusability, easier maintenance, and scalability, helping in building complex applications more efficiently.

 **What is “props” short for?**  
  "Props" is short for "properties," and refers to the custom data passed into React components for dynamic and reusable functionality.

 **How are props used in React?**  
  Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components in React, allowing for component customization and dynamic content rendering.
