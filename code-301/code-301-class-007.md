## **Questions & Answers**
### What is node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and enables the development of scalable network applications.

### In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is a high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine developed by Google for the Chrome browser. It compiles JavaScript code directly into native machine code, significantly improving execution speed and efficiency.

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
Being a JavaScript runtime means that Node.js provides an environment outside of a web browser where JavaScript code can run. This allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

### What is npm?
npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js, providing a repository for thousands of open-source packages for Node.js development. It facilitates package installation, version management, and dependency management for Node.js applications.

### What version of node are you running on your machine?

Node.js v21.7.1.

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?  

npm@10.5.0

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

### What is node used for?
Node.js is used for developing a variety of applications such as web applications, REST APIs, real-time chat applications, command-line tools, and even for IoT devices. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it suitable for building scalable network applications.

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
1. Improved code quality
2. Enhanced problem-solving skills
3. Increased team productivity
4. Knowledge sharing and mentorship
5. Better team communication
6. Reduced risk of project delays

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
"Knowledge sharing and mentorship" is one of the most beneficial aspects of pair programming, as it accelerates learning and expertise development within teams.

### How does pair programming work?
Pair programming involves two developers working together at one workstation to write code. Typically, one, the "driver," writes the code while the other, the "navigator," reviews each line of code as it is typed, suggests improvements, and thinks about the overall direction of the work. This collaborative approach helps catch errors early, facilitates learning, and boosts productivity.
