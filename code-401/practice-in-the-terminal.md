# Practice In The Terminal

### The Command Line
The command line, or terminal, is a text-based interface where users input commands to interact with the operating system. You can access it by searching for "Terminal" on Linux or macOS, and "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" on Windows.

### Basic Navigation
Linux uses a hierarchical directory system, and basic navigation can be done using commands like `cd` to change directories, `ls` to list directory contents, and `pwd` to display the current directory path.

### More About Files
In a Linux environment, files and directories can have various attributes like permissions, ownership, and timestamps that dictate how they are accessed and managed. Commands like `ls -l` display these attributes.

### Manual Pages
Manual pages, or man pages, provide comprehensive documentation for Linux commands. Access them by typing `man` followed by the command name, e.g., `man ls`, to learn about its usage and options.

### File Manipulation
In Linux, you can create files using `touch`, remove them with `rm`, rename or move them with `mv`, and copy files with `cp`. These commands are fundamental for managing files and directories from the command line.

### Cheat Sheet
This cheat sheet summarizes the main points: use `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd` for navigation; `touch`, `rm`, `mv`, and `cp` for file manipulation; and `man` to access manual pages for detailed command information.
