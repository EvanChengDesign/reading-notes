## **Questions & Answers**  

### Readings: Redux - Combined Reducers

**Why create multiple reducers?**
Creating multiple reducers allows for better organization and separation of concerns by managing different parts of the state independently.

**How would you combine multiple reducers?**
You combine multiple reducers using the `combineReducers` function, which merges them into a single reducing function that manages the state tree.

**How will you manage state as an immutable object? Why?**
State is managed as an immutable object to ensure that state changes are predictable and easier to track, which helps in debugging and maintaining the application.

**combineReducers is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing ____ _____.**
Redux reducers.

**Explain how combineReducers assembles the new state tree.**
`combineReducers` assembles the new state tree by delegating slices of state to the corresponding reducer functions, each managing its own section of the state tree.

**How would you define initial state in an app using combineReducers?**
Initial state is defined by specifying initial values within each individual reducer function, which are then combined into the overall initial state tree.

**Why will you want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex?**
Splitting reducing functions helps manage the complexity by isolating logic related to different parts of the state, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.

**The _____ helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to _____.**
`combineReducers`, `createStore`.

**What is a popular convention when naming reducers?**
A popular convention is to name reducers after the part of the state they manage, often using the plural form of the noun (e.g., `usersReducer`, `postsReducer`).
