## **Questions & Answers**

### Readings: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

**Why use Redux middleware?**
Redux middleware allows for extending Redux capabilities by enabling side effects like asynchronous actions, logging, and crash reporting.

**Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.**
The flow starts with a user interaction triggering an action, which is then intercepted by middleware to handle any asynchronous operations. Once the async operation completes, the middleware dispatches a new action with the result, which is processed by reducers to update the state.

**How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?**
We accommodate async in our Redux app by using middleware like `redux-thunk` to handle asynchronous operations within action creators, allowing us to dispatch actions before and after the async tasks.

**Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?**
You need `redux-thunk` middleware to enable action creators to return functions (thunks) instead of plain action objects, allowing for delayed dispatching of actions or dispatching based on asynchronous logic.

**Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.**
function.

**Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.**
Any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available as the return value of the dispatch call, allowing the caller to use it for further processing or chaining additional operations.
