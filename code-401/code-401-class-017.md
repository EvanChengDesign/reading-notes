## **Questions & Answers**

**What is Amazon S3?**
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service provided by AWS for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time.

**Name some use cases for Amazon S3.**
1. Backup and disaster recovery
2. Data archiving
3. Hosting static websites
4. Storing large data sets for analytics

**Name some benefits of using Amazon S3.**
1. High durability and availability
2. Scalability to handle growing data needs
3. Cost-effective storage solutions
4. Integration with other AWS services

**What is AWS Lambda?**
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, executing code in response to events.

**Name some use cases for AWS Lambda.**
1. Real-time file processing (e.g., image resizing)
2. Automated backups and cleanups
3. Running scheduled tasks
4. Integrating with other AWS services to build event-driven applications

**Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.**
"Serverless" means you can run your applications without having to manage the underlying servers. The cloud provider automatically handles the infrastructure, so you can focus on writing your code.

**What is a CDN?**
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers that deliver web content and resources to users based on their geographic location.

**How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?**
A CDN caches content in servers located closer to the user, reducing latency and load times by serving data from the nearest server rather than the origin server.

**What are the benefits of employing a CDN?**
1. Faster content delivery and improved user experience
2. Reduced load on the origin server
3. Enhanced security through DDoS protection and mitigation
4. Better handling of traffic spikes and high availability
