## **Questions & Answers**  
### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
Node.js is like a magic tool that lets you run JavaScript (the language of web browsers) on your computer or a server, allowing it to do tasks like reading files or handling multiple users at the same time.

### What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
Saying that Node is a JavaScript runtime means it's an environment that executes JavaScript code. Normally JavaScript runs in web browsers, but Node lets it run on servers or local machines.

### What is Node used for?
Node.js is used for building various types of applications like websites, back-end services, and even desktop apps. It's particularly famous for its efficiency in handling tasks that require a lot of simultaneous connections, like live chat apps.

### Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
I'm looking forward to learning about building real-time web applications using Node.js, especially how it handles data on the fly with its non-blocking architecture.

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
My goal is to understand the fundamentals of Node.js thoroughly, including asynchronous programming and its event-driven nature, and to apply these concepts to build scalable network applications.
